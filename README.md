This repository contains the code, images, amd two working examples of processed images.

## File/ Folder Explination:

* Image_Processing = main script used to process images. Relfects most recent implementations, values for thresholds are not a "one-size-fits-all", so this may  prodice differnt results for different images.
* Image_13_Processing = script optimized for image 13. This is an example script used to demostrate the software, values for thresholds are oprimized for image 13!
* Image_21Processing = script optimized for image 21. This is an example script used to demostrate the software, values for thresholds are oprimized for image 21!
* Run_All = python script to be used in shell to run an entire folder of images for pre-processing. This was used early on to determine how to best capture images. Doet not fully process images, only convert to binary.
* Other folders contian images captured, folders named on day captured.
